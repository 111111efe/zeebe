   * <p><b> If we change or replace the dispatcher implementation we should check if the current
   * defined key space size is still valid. </b>
   *
   * <p>Calculation is done as follows:
   *
   * <p>On each segment 2^32 bytes can be written, we can have 2^32 segments. This means we can at
   * maximum write 2*32 * 2^32 = 18446744073709551616 bytes. If we assume an avg event size of
   * 15_000 bytes (due to payload and so on) we can calculate the maximum events which can be
   * written to the dispatcher. `maximumEvents = maximumBytes / eventAvgSize = 1229782938247303.5`
   * We can then calculate the min pow of 2 to reach this value like: log(2, 1229782938247303.5).
   * This means we need a keyspace of 2^51 to have more keys then possible writable events.
