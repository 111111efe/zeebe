<h1>Nomenclature</h1>

This section defines commonly used terminology referenced within the Zeebe documentation.

**Workflow**:  A workflow is a defined sequence of distinct steps representing your business logic.  Examples of a workflow could be making e-commerce shopping experience, a process to onboard a new employee, etc.  In Zeebe nomenclature, workflows are identified by a unique name and bpmn process id.  The workflow is usually also referred to as the BPMN model.

_Workflow Instance_:  While a workflow represents a defined sequence of distinct steps representing your business logic, a workflow instance represents a currently executing or completing workflow.  For a single workflow, there could be many associated workflow instances in various stages of their executing cycle.   Workflow instances are identitied by workflow instance id.  Executing workflows are also sometimes referred to as inflight workflows.

_Workflow Variable_:  A workflow variable represents the execution state of a workflow instance.  The variables capture business process parameters which are input and output of various stages of the workflow instance and which also influence process flow execution.

_Workflow Deployment_: a workflow definition cannot execute unless the broker is aware of its existence. This is done by deploying a committing a workflow definition to the broker. The act of pushing of broker is referred to as workflow deployment.

_Broker_:  A broker is an instance of a Zeebe installation which executes workflows and manages workflow state.  A single broker will be installed on a single machine.

_Cluster_:  A cluster represents a configuration of one or more brokers collaborating to execute workflows.  Each broker in a cluster acts as a leader or a follower.  

_Leader_:  In a clustered environment, one broker tis responsible for workflow execution and housekeeping.  Housekeeping includes, taking snapshots, replication and running exports for a given partition.

_Follower_:  In a clustered environment, a broker which is not a leader is a follower of a given partition.  A follower assumes leader responsibilities when the leader goes down.

_Record_: A Zeebe record is a collection of workflow variables and other state transitions of an executing workflow instance at a given point in time.  During execution of a workflow instance numerous records will be generated to capture the various state transitions from start to workflow instance completion.

_Event_:  Within the context of Zeebe, an event represent a state transition associated with an executing workflow instance.  Events include variable changes, changes to transition elements in the workflow model, etc.   An event will be represented by a timestamp, the variable name and variable value.  These events are stored in an append-only log.

_Log_:  An ordered sequence of events written in persistent storage. This log file is only appended-to and is stored on disk.  

_Segment_:  Data within a log file is segments.  Segments are defined by time period.???

_Partition_:  A partition represents a logical grouping of data in as Zeebe broker.  This data includes workflow instance variables and events generated by Zeebe.  Partitions are determined by ???? 

_Replication_:  In a clustered Zeebe installation configured with more than one broker, data in a partition is copied to the other brokers.  This act of copying data in partitions from one broker to another is also referred to as replication.
   
_Replication Factor_:  This is the number of times data in a partition will be shared and this depends on the number of brokers in a cluster.  The concept of sharing here implies that other brokers should have the exact same copy of data in all partitions.  Data replication allows the system to be resilient to brokers going down. 

_Snapshot_:  The state of all active workflows instances, (these are also known as inflight workflow instances) are stored as records in an in-memory database called  RocksDb.  All events generated as a result of execution of a workflow instance in Zeebe are stored in an append-only log file.  A **snapshot** represents a copy of all data within a partition (including event logs and workflow instance variables in RocksDb) at any given point in time.  Snapshots are binary images stored on disk and can be used to restore execution state of a workflow.   The size of a snapshot is affected by the size of the data.  Size of the data depends on several factors including complexity of the model or business process, the size and quantity of variables in each workflow instance as well as the total number of executing workflow instances in a broker.

_Exporter_:  An exporter represents a sink to which Zeebe will submitted records representing completed workflow state.  

_Message_:  Within the context of workflow execution, a **message** contains information to be delivered to interested parties.  Messages can be published via Kafka or Zeebeâ€™s internal messaging system.  Messages are associated with timestamp and other constraints such as time-to-live (TTL).  

_Correlation_:  Correlation refers to the act of matching a **message** with an inflight workflow instance. 

_Correlation Key_: A correlation key is an attribute within a **message** which is used to match this message against a certain variable within an inflight workflow instance.  If the value of the correlation key matches the value of the variable within the workflow instance, the message is matched to this workflow instance.

_Job_: A job represents a distinct unit of work within a business process.  Jobs are represented by steps in your workflow definition and are identified by a unique name.  

**Timeouts:**

_Job Activation Timeout_:  This is the amount of time the broker will wait for a response from the client after a job has been submitted to the client for processing before it marks the job as completed or failed.  An incomplete job prevents Zeebe from advancing workflow execution to the next step.  

_Request Timeout_:  This is how long a Zeebe client will wait for a response from the Zeebe broker after the client has submitted a request.  If a response is not received within the client request timeout, the client can consider the broker unreachable.
