# Performance

Zeebe is designed for performance applying the following design principles:

* Batching of I/O operations
* Linear read/write data access patterns
* Compact, cache-optimized data structures
* Lock free algorithms and actor concurrency (green threads model)
* Broker is garbage-free in the hot/data path

As a result, Zeebe is capable of processing events at a rate of 160K â€“ 200K events/s on modern SSDs & Gbit Ethernet.

Note however: there are some performance regressions in the 0.1.0 release which are planned to be improved for 0.2.0.
